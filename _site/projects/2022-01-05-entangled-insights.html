      <p><p class="content">
This paper is a working draft that was originally produced between the summer of 2020 and spring of 2021. We've chosen to publish the document as a draft because it marks a significant milestone in how we began to understand the benefits and complexities of using feminist theory in visualization research. That summer we read <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway</i><img src="/assets/images/barad-bookcover.jpeg" alt="an image of the cover of Meeting the Universe Halfway. It has red and purple abstract art on it with the words: quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning" width="25%" />
by Karen Barad and this paper is a result of discussing and theorizing Barad's theory of entanglements with the field of visualization's theorizing about insights. Since then, our thoughts have changed and it is likely some later draft of this paper will be quite different, but we provide this paper as an archive.
