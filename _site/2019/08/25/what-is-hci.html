      <p><p>Although I wish this were an article about cats, it’s really about Human Computer Intercation. I don’t imagine that this acronym is well known outside of academia, but it should be. snap snap!</p>

<p>Why you may ask? Well, before I answer your question, let’s examine what you are currently doing. You are looking at my website, using a mouse to maybe switch to a tab with more interesting content like cat videos, enjoying the ability to have four different overlapping window screens simultaneously on view because you are so good at multi-tasking…Well my friend, you have HCI research to thank for that.</p>

<p>Human Computer Interaction, or Human Centered Computing, is a field of research in Computer Science that takes an interdisciplinary approach to CS. It is pretty straight forward, “humans and computers interacting,” right? That was my thinking before beginning to take some HCI courses. My HCI professor Tamara Denning posed the evocative questions when considering the three letters of this acronym.</p>

<p>Human:
Could be one person, could be groups of people, could be whole societies? What about our furry pals? Are cats humans?
Computer:
What is a computer? A laptop? What about augmented reality devices, internet of things, robots?
Interaction:
Do we only interact with computer interfaces? What about the data collected while using social media?
So as you can hopefully see, HCI touches a lot of our lives! What is fascinating to me, as someone coming from a design and cognitive science background, is the overlapping research done across these disciplines. Many qualitative methods for conducting HCI research are also recommended best practices in design thinking.</p>

<p>As a closing note, here is a cat on a computer.
