      <p><p>Came across this image on perspective: Iâ€™ve tried to figure out the illustrator + origin, but both Google and Pinterest failed me. (For all I know, the poster could be about something completely different, so if you have any leads on it please let me know!)</p>

<p>Completely ignorant about the text, the colors and simplicity really struck me and I decided to play around a little with the background image. Yes, there is probably some deep meaning about the images I chose (like cows representing veganism and mountains representing the humbling power of nature), but ultimately the decisions were based on colors and composition.</p>
