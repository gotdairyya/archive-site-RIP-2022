      <h2>Communicating Science Research</h2>
      <h3 class="header__subtext">computers + bats</h3>
  
      <p><h3 class="date">10 Sep 2020</h3>

<p><p>In early July I was a participant in the <a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon Flagship workshop</a>. The 3-day workshop was conducted over Zoom and covered a variety of topics on how to communicate science research with non-scientists (we are all scientists but some of us choose to pursue it as a career). We discussed topics like empathy, complicating the narrative, heard from speakers on IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility), and did a little improv to practice discomfort and thinking on our feet.</p>

<p>As part of the conference, we were required to write a pop-science piece and then submit it to different journals. My piece was accepted by <em>Natural History</em> and published in the September 2020 issue along with other ComSciCon participants.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that I want to stress from this experience is that COMPUTER SCIENCE NEEDS MORE POP SCIENCE WRITERS!!!!! The Natural Sciences have it DOWN. But why let them have all the fun? Computers are in our daily lives, in our pockets, mediating the world we live in, and we (not the royal we, but the we-as-a-society we) would greatly benefit from a larger collective understanding about what computers are, what they do, and what research is being conducted about them!</p>

<p>IF YOU ARE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST READING THIS, LET’S TALK!!!</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a wonderful experience working with an editor (thank you for all of the comments and feedback!). I’ve listed resources on how to pitch to an editor below.</p>

<p>You can read the piece by buying the magazine, or <a href="/assets/images/nh/Sep20-NH-digital-edition.pdf">here is my digital copy</a>.</p>
