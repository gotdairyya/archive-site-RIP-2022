      <h3 class="header__subtext">And all that I learned</h3>

      <p><p>It’s in many ways unbelievable to me that my first academic year of my PhD has come to an end. Not that I didn’t think I would make it, but more so I could not have even imagined the state of the world as it is now.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has affected all of our lives sounds like an understatement. I take a few moments each day while I am slightly panicked or overwhelmed to pause and pretend how in a few years from now I will be looking back and recounting all the disruptions and things that I have learned in this moment.</p>

<p>So what is it that I have learned?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>(1) Don’t take anything for granted.</strong>
This includes the little things like going to the grocery store after 8pm. And the big things, like cherishing the time you spend with friends and family.</li>
  <li><strong>(2) Video calls are awesome.</strong>
I think after this has passed I will continue to video call my friends and family. Video calling has helped me to pause and remain present during phone calls, when in the past I viewed calls as something to do while I was doing other things. I have come to love quick little updates from my family. Even the long video calls with my sister as we walk around our neighborhoods, East Bench and the Bronx, talking about nothing and everything at the same time.</li>
  <li><strong>(3) Everything takes time.</strong>
In some ways this year was harder than I imagined it would be. On and off I was plagued with imposter syndrome, worried that I was not doing research right. And I’m not sure when this happened, but towards the end of the semester something clicked for me – all of this is just going to take time and practice. In the same way that I have been learning how to enjoy the act of running, I am learning how to be a PhD student. There is definitely something meta here like “it’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey” and sure that totally applies, but no one mentioned the liberation you can feel when you begin to embrace that mindset.</li>
  <li><strong>(4) Epistemology is not an onomatopoeia for a sneeze.</strong> In fact, it is a super useful term to have in your toolbox and can help explain why you may disagree with someone else’s conclusions. I plan on writing an entry about this soon.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t necessarily have a good conclusion for this entry because I am in a state of learning and processing but I have been accepted to <a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon</a> and I hope that through the weekend virtual workshop I will have some new methods of communicating to experiment with!</p>
