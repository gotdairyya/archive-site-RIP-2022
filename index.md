In my work I focus on understanding the role that design and technology currently does and *will* play in people's ability to find information and create lasting understanding. With a non-traditional background in Labor Relations, Cognitive Science, and Economics, I consider myself a self-taught creator and maker. Inspired by the great interdisciplinary thinkers before me, I hope to emulate work that is as thoughtful and inventive.

Growing up the got milk? ads were so clever, so fun, and plus I loved milk, so naturally, when I started using dairy-ya as the "phonetic" spelling of my name, I couldn't help but add a got to the front and turn it into my online persona.
