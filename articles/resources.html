      <p> Over the years I have collected a smathering of articles, websites, online toolkits that I have found useful in my personal practice. I only chose to share a few here (mostly due to laziness, so if there is anything you are searching for
        and cannot find, I am always happy to lend a hand. </p>
      <p>A note on the list: with any heirarchical classification you will find that some entries <em>should</em> be in multiple
        categories, but I have deliberately chosen to keep them to one.</p>
