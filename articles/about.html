          In my work I focus on understanding the role that design and technology currently does and <em>will</em> play in people's ability to find information and create lasting understanding. With a non-traditional background in Labor Relations,
          Cognitive Science,
          and Economics, I consider myself a self-taught creator and maker. Inspired by the great interdisciplinary thinkers before me, I hope to emulate work that is as thoughtful and inventive.</p>
        <p>I have currently begun my quest as a PhD student at the University of Utah's School of Computing. <strong> Read more <a href="whyaphd.com" target="_blank">here</a></strong>
