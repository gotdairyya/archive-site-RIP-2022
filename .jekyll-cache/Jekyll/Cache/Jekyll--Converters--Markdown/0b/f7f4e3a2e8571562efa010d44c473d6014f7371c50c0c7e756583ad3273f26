I"Ä<p>Since starting my PhD I have read A LOT. Now, you, like my wise friend Treasure may be saying, â€œWell duh derya, didnâ€™t you know that thatâ€™s what a PhD is?!â€ Well. My wise friends, I did not.</p>

<p>So like I was saying, Iâ€™ve been reading a lot and Iâ€™ve decided to use this blog as a way of reflecting on articles that Iâ€™ve found interesting/still have opinions on/want to go further than a one hour group discussion. To my peersâ€™ credit though, discussion is so critical, and without them I donâ€™t think I would be nearly as informed.</p>
