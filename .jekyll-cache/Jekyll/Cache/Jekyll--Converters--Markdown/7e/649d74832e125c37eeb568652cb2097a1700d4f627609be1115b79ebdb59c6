I"7<p>Since starting my PhD I have read A LOT. Now, you, like my wise friend Treasure may be saying, “Well duh derya, didn’t you know that that’s what a PhD is?!” Well. My wise friends, I did not.</p>

<p>So like I was saying, I’ve been reading a lot and I’ve decided to use this blog as a way of reflecting on articles that I’ve found interesting/still have opinions on/want to go further than a one hour group discussion. To my peers’ credit though, discussion is so critical, and without them I don’t think I would be nearly as informed.</p>

<h3 id="why-authors-dont-visualize-uncertainty">Why Authors Don’t Visualize Uncertainty</h3>

<p><em>Written by Jessica Hullman (<a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/Value_of_Uncertainty_Vis_CR.pdf">full paper here</a>)</em></p>

<p>In this paper, Hullman investigates why visualization authors don’t visualize uncertainty when they know that it exists. The title of the paper is pretty self-explanatory, but there are some interesting discussion topics that I will dive deeper into.</p>

<p>Let’s start with defining uncertainty in the visualization space.
Uncertainty can enter the visualization pipeline at many steps of the process, resulting in different types of uncertainty. Below is a simple pipeline illustrating potential areas where uncertainty may be introduced.</p>

<p><em>As a side note, these are the same spaces where there are potential biases filtering in. Read <a href="http://www.kanarinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IEEE_Feminist_Data_Visualization.pdf">Feminist Data Visualization</a> for a more nuanced discussion.</em></p>

<h4 id="visualizing-uncertainty-is-hard">Visualizing uncertainty is hard!</h4>
<p>As you can see in the figure above, there are different types of uncertainty that could or could not be visualized. And based on what I have gathered through informal questioning (no formal review of the literature yet), there are no standard methods for visualizing uncertainty because really the choices you would have to make as a visualization designer all depend on the context.</p>

<p>So what do the 90 visualization experts surveyed by Hullman do when confronted with uncertainty?</p>
