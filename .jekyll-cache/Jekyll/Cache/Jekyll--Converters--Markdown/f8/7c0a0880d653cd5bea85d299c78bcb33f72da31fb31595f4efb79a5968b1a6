I"î<p>If you know a little about my past life (before pursuing a PhD, not in the karmic sense), you would know that I worked on a theory for economic classification systems. So it was no wonder that when <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sorting-things-out">‚ÄúSorting things out: classification and its consequences‚Äù</a> showed up on my goodreads, my old co-worker promptly commented ‚Äúwow who are you!!!‚Äù</p>

<p>One would think 6 years embedded in discussions about classification systems would be enough for a lifetime‚Ä¶THINK AGAIN. I definitely had a moment where I felt incredulous picking up the book, but as soon as I started reading it, I knew I had made the right decision. This post is an attempt to capture some of the memorable aspects before they slip from my failing memory.</p>

<h2 id="classification-systems-are-invisible-infrastructres">Classification Systems are (invisible) Infrastructres</h2>
<p>If there is one major takeaway, it would be these:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1.classification systems are often invisible</li>
  <li>2.classification systems are powerful</li>
  <li>3.classification systems are infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="invisibility">Invisibility</h3>

<p>Classification shapes the way that we think about the world and how we record that thought. Often, we do not think about how we are labeling the world around us (invisibility). We see an object and call it a flower. Or if we are a florist, we call it a peony. These examples are trivial seem trivial, but in instances like classifying a disease, where many different causes might be at play, the choice in what and how to classify alters the types of treatment one may recieve.</p>

<h3 id="power">Power</h3>

<p>In chapter 6 the authors discuss the very real ways in which classification of race during apertheid in South Africa affected peoples lives: limiting access to resources, dividing families, and numerous reclassifications. For a metaphysical discussion about race, please read ‚Äú‚ÄòBut What Are You Really?‚Äô The Metaphysics of Race‚Äù by Charles Mills.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Additionally, classification systems as markers of community membership struck me as a super fascinating concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúCategories are historically situated artifacts and, like all artifacts, are learned as part of membership in communities of practice.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They go on to discuss classification systems as boundary infrastructures, where classification systems serve as interpretable and flexible infrastructure on the edges of different communities.</p>

<p>I think we grapple with this all the time in my field (or any field that works with data). We assume that data means one thing and then quickly (if we are fortunate) find that it means something quite different to our collaborators. I think this is because as Johanna Drucker <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html">states</a> oh so eloquently, ‚Äú<em>Data are capta</em>, taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it.‚Äù The act of creating data is an act of classification: what is classified, who classifies, why classified‚Ä¶This is is a thread in feminist data visualization that I think deserves more discussion, but I feel the limitations of that discussion because we are just flooded with data every second of every day. Where can we find the time to pause and examine the construction of data? When can we refuse data as given? A thread to be continued elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="design-opportunities">Design Opportunities</h2>
<p>In the last two pages of the book, the authors provide recommendations for how to design classification systems. <em>Why only two pages?</em> I summarize the recommendations here:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Having ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù in classification systems is a good thing.</strong> It provides space and flexibility for using these systems across different contexts.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep the people who designed the systems visible.</strong> This will hopefully prevent the system from becoming invisible and as such assumed as natural and a given.</li>
  <li><strong>Be aware of what/who falls into other categories.</strong> Essentially, anyone or thing not specifically classified becomes lost in the archive, blending with everything else placed in the other category. There are mixed reactions to this in current feminist and queer literature. For example, ‚ÄúBecoming NULL: Queer relations in the excluded middle‚Äù by Jacob Gaboury, advocates that the NULL using the category is a subversive act that reduces the effectivenes of data (specifically in the context of surveillance). While in ‚ÄúUncertain Archives: Approaching the Unknowns, Errors, and Vulnerabilities of Big Data through Cultural Theories of the Archive,‚Äù Agostinho et al. discuss the tension between exclusion from archival data, an erasure from history, and increasing surveillance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, while many of us tend to use data and are critical of it to some extent, a discussion may be worth having of the content of the classification system‚Ä¶ where it came from and how does it frame the way we consider the phenomena at hand.</p>
