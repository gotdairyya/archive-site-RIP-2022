I"r<p>Make a Mark is a nonprofit that organizes 12hr design events to connect designers and other makers with nonprofits that are serving the community. In January 2018, I participated as a maker working on a design equity campaign for Make a Mark itself. Their work is invaluable in bridging the gap between good design and nonprofits that desperately need it; however, itâ€™s not always apparent why design is useful and how it can be used. As a result my team, consisting of an illustrator, copy writer, and myself, went to work creating social media content that Make a Mark could use to educate the nonprofit community.</p>
