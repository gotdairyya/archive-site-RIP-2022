<p>I have always been fascinated with how we come to know things. Not just from a memorization perspective (in fact, I remember what I once memorized, but can no longer recall the content, which makes me question <em>the point</em>), but rather from an embodied perspective. When do our muscles remember how to ride a bike? or our taste buds recommend the tiniest bit of lemon juice to balance the flavors? The inspiration for this post came when I was exchanging Turkish recipes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> with a friend, who was in turn exchanging Bangladeshi recipes. In addition to the recipe, we both included long explanations of what needed to be done so that the recipe would turn out like the way our grand-/mothers made the recipe (aka the right way). The ancesteral, cultural, and gustatory knowledge was embedded in the practice of cooking, eating and family; and yet, mostly missing from the black and white text of the recipes. We attempted to fill in this gap with more text, but it is unclear either of us will make the dishes authentically. This exchange reminded me about two academic concepts that I have been fascinated with as of late: tacit knowledge in science and pedagogical content knowledge in education. Both relate to how <em>verbs</em> are done and the quality to which they are done. Below I include a BRIEF overview of each. I am still new to both fields/concepts, and so I would love further recommendations and to engage in more discussion (just tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/gotdairyya">@gotdairyya</a>).</p>

<p>In the social studies of science, tacit knowledge has been studied as the magic sauce for getting science done. In H.M. Collinsâ€™ Paper<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, he discusses how tacit knowledge plays an important role in measuring the quality of sapphire. <em>A brief aside, the shortening of the quality of sapphire is the q of sapphire and that always conjures up for me images of Quailman.</em> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4EpkQcjHPsr9tTP2/giphy.gif" alt="GIF of Quailman an early 2000s cartoon character" class="content" /></p>
