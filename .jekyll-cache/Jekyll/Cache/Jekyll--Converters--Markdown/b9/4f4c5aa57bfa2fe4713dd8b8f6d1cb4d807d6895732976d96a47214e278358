I"¡<p>In 2019, I was selected to participate in a 2-week workshop called ‚ÄòCode, Paper, Scissors‚Äô run by the <a href="https://sfpc.io/">School For Poetic Computation</a>. The course was centered around the following question:</p>

Data are often required to be read in specific ways, like tables or charts, but what happens when we change the channel? My project focused on sonifying the housing prices and yearly income across zipcodes in NYC.</p>

<p>Using Census data for median income and Zillow data for median rent prices per zipcode, I calculated the affordability of homes in cities across the US. Home are considered affordable when you are spending less than 30% of your income on rent.</p>

<p>Using music boxes as instruments to present the data, my mapping of affordability was constrained to the materiality of the boxes. I presented affordability in two ways:</p>
