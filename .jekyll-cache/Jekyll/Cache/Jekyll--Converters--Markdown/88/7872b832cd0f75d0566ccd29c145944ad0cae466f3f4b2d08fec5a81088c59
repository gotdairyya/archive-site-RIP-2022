I"F<p>This year I am taking a class taught by my advisor Miriah Meyer on ontologies, epistemologies, and research paradigms. I will have to write another post on what those words mean at some point, but for now I want to focus on an interesting conversation we have been having: how can researchers communicate rigor if their work is qualitative.</p>

<h3 id="learning-to-trust-a-positivist-perspective">Learning to Trust: a Positivist Perspective</h3>

<p>Positivism is a research paradigm often associated with the natural sciences. In the world of positivism, there are objective and generalizable truths that can be measured. Within positivism, research results are judged according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal Validity:</strong> how certain are you that the independent variable has effected the dependent variable?</li>
  <li><strong>External Validity:</strong> how representative is the sample population (and by extension your results) of the general population?</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility &amp; Reliability:</strong> how likely are the results to show up again in another experiment? how well can another researcher run your experiment?</li>
  <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> are the measurements value free?</li>
</ul>

<p>These criteria are often associated with quantitative studies, but they become problematic when there is no <em>one</em> answer to your research, no <em>one</em> singular truth, and when the socio-, historical-, political- contexts of the experiment can greatly affect your results.</p>

<p>Enter, Lincoln, Guba, and interpretivism.</p>

<p>The following section is my take on organizing the work presented in <a href="https://ethnographyworkshop.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lincoln-guba-1985-establishing-trustworthiness-naturalistic-inquiry.pdf">Establishing Trustworthiness</a>. Written in 1985, this document from my understanding is a seminal piece in interpretivist research methods. Lincoln and Guba set out to both make a case for interpretivism (the research paradigm that multiple realities exist and it is the role of the researcher to interpret it) and provide practical methods for establishing trust and rigor in qualitative research.</p>

<p><strong>Credibility</strong> <br />
<em>Counter: internal validity.</em>
How congruent are the findings with reality?</p>
