In my work I use critical theory as a lens for understanding the intersection of design and technology within the field of Information Visualization. With a less than “traditional” background in Labor Relations, Cognitive Science, and Economics, I am inspired by the intersections across disciplines and interrogating the differences (and similarities) that matter.

Growing up the got milk? ads were so clever, so fun, and plus I loved milk, so naturally, when I started using dairy-ya as the “phonetic” spelling of my name, I couldn’t help but add a got to the front and turn it into my online persona.</p>
