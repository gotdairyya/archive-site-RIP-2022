In my work I use critical theory as a lens for understanding the intersection of design and technology within the field of Information Visualization. With a less than ‚Äútraditional‚Äù background in Labor Relations, Cognitive Science, and Economics, I am inspired by the intersections across disciplines and interrogating the differences (and similarities) that matter. Inspired by the great interdisciplinary thinkers before me, I hope to emulate work that is as thoughtful, responsible, and inventive.</p>

Growing up the got milk? ads were so clever, so fun, and plus I loved milk, so naturally, when I started using dairy-ya as the ‚Äúphonetic‚Äù spelling of my name, I couldn‚Äôt help but add a got to the front and turn it into my online persona.</p>
