<p>Make a Mark is a nonprofit that organizes 12hr design events to connect designers and other makers with nonprofits that are serving the community. In January 2018, I participated as a maker working on a design equity campaign for Make a Mark itself. Their work is invaluable in bridging the gap between good design and nonprofits that desperately need it; however, it’s not always apparent why design is useful and how it can be used. As a result my team, consisting of an illustrator, copy writer, and myself, went to work creating social media content that Make a Mark could use to educate the nonprofit community.</p>

<p>The series is called Design Equity and can be read on <a href="https://medium.com/makeamark/design-equity-youve-got-a-story-to-tell-tell-it-beautifully-74917a7d0cab">Medium</a>.

<p>After the event, I blown away by the impact a mere 12 hours could do that I volunteered as a site leader for the 2019 Make-a-Thon along with two talented designers <a href="https://anarealmuto.com/">Ana Reamulto</a> and <a href="https://www.rebeccaglad.com/">Rebecca Gladstone</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain just HOW DIFFICULT running an event is! Shout out and mad respect to all the event planners out there! It took Ana, Rebecca, and me about one year to plan a 1-day event. There is so much that I learned from this experience.</p>

<p>For one, your planning team has your back. Only by leaning on each other we were able to put this event together (that and the help of Sarah who started Make a Mark, she is super woman.)</p>

<p>Setting a budget really helped us ask for specific monetary and in-kind donations. Organizations are willing to help but you need to know what kind of help you need. We also had more luck reaching out to local businesses in NYC when it came to food donations because larger organizations tend to have long bureaucratic (read: impenetrable) processes.</p>
