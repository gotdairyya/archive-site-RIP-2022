I".	<p>I often get asked – what is data vis? My answer is often: “Well, it’s visualizing data.” So helpful. I know.</p>

<p>So, inspired by the very unhelpful patent images of the <a href="https://noahveltman.com/internet-shape/">shape of the internet</a> found by Noah Veltman, I have found equally unhappy images of data visualizations. Enjoy!</p>

<p><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150220607A1/en?q=data+visualization&amp;oq=data+visualization"><img src="assets/images/data-vis/contextual-vis.png" alt="strange white man from the 50s" class="responsive-image" /></a></p>

<p>Came across this image on perspective: I’ve tried to figure out the illustrator + origin, but both Google and Pinterest failed me. (For all I know, the poster could be about something completely different, so if you have any leads on it please let me know!)</p>

<p>Completely ignorant about the text, the colors and simplicity really struck me and I decided to play around a little with the background image. Yes, there is probably some deep meaning about the images I chose (like cows representing veganism and mountains representing the humbling power of nature), but ultimately the decisions were based on colors and composition.</p>
