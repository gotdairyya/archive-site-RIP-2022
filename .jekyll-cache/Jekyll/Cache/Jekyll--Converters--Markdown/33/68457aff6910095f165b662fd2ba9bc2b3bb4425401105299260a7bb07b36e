I"£<p>If you know a little about my past life (before pursuing a PhD, not in the karmic sense), you would know that I worked on a theory for economic classification systems. So it was no wonder that when <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sorting-things-out">â€œSorting things out: classification and its consequencesâ€</a> showed up on my goodreads, my old co-worker promptly commented â€œwow who are you!!!â€</p>
