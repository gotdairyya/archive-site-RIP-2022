I"¢<p><em>A note from future me: Prior to my PhD I had what I would call the most interesting job one could have. I worked at a firm focused on developing a systems-based economic model, called <a href="home.locus">Locus Analytics</a>. While there I developed the design language for communicating a model that is built on semantic and syntactical relations. Below is a post from 2017 regarding some of my work.</em></p>
