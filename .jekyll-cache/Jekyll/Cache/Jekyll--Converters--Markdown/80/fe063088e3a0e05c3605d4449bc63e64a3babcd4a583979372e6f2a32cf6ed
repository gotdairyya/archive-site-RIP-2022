In my work I focus on understanding the role that design and technology currently does and <em>will</em> play in peopleâ€™s ability to find information and create lasting understanding. With a non-traditional background in Labor Relations, Cognitive Science, and Economics, I consider myself a self-taught creator and maker. Inspired by the great interdisciplinary thinkers before me, I hope to emulate work that is as thoughtful and inventive.</p>

Growing up the got milk? ads were so clever, so fun, and plus I loved milk, so naturally, when I started using dairy-ya as the â€œphoneticâ€ spelling of my name, I couldnâ€™t help but add a got to the front and turn it into my online persona.</p>
