I"<p>In early July I was a participant in the <a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon Flagship workshop</a>. The 3-day workshop was conducted over Zoom and covered a variety of topics on how to communicate science research with non-scientists (we are all scientists but some of us choose to pursue it as a career). We discussed topics like empathy, complicating the narrative, heard from speakers on IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility), and did a little improv to practice discomfort and thinking on our feet.</p>
