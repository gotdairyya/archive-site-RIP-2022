      <p>I decided that a PhD was for me when I attended the <a href="http://www.openvisconf.com/">OpenVis conference</a> in Paris and realized I would never get tired of hearing people talk about visualization (and I have a love of croissants).</p>

      <p>
        At the foundation of my work is the belief that everyone is capable of learning complex topics and making informed decisions. As technology becomes increasingly intertwined in our daily lives, there exists a bright future where there is
        equality in information accessibility that could result in educated decision making globally. But the past decade has shown that with technology comes the sinister side-effect of information overload and misinformation, threatening to
        dismantle the promises of technology: for with information, understanding and knowledge will not always follow.

      <p>
        I am pursuing a PhD because I believe in the power of thoughtfully-crafted and human-centered technology to change (and possible alleviate) our lives. My goals are to help people wade through dense information and deeply learn complex topics
        through data visualization and thoughtful design.

        The researchers I strive to emulate are effective communicators, inclusive practitioners, and open-minded educators. This includes (but is not limited to) Elizabeth Patitsas (McGill), Mike Bostock (father of d3), Andy Ko (U of Washington),
        Zach Lieberman (technologist and artist).
      </p>
      <p>
        I admire these individuals for the interdisciplinary foundation that supports their research and that the impact they wish to have on society is one of positive change and growth. Aside from their published results in academic journals,
        they are active in their communities and provide resources to society at large.
