Came across this image on perspective: I've tried to figure out the illustrator + origin, but both Google and Pinterest failed me. (For all I know, the poster could be about something completely different, so if you have any leads on it please let me know!)

Completely ignorant about the text, the colors and simplicity really struck me and I decided to play around a little with the background image. Yes, there is probably some deep meaning about the images I chose (like cows representing veganism and mountains representing the humbling power of nature), but ultimately the decisions were based on colors and composition.
