One of my biggest accomplishments at Locus was developing a visual language that is a tightly controlled system, illustrating the structure, function, and order of the various components and relationships within an Economic System based on the Locus theory. Colors and shapes operate as mnemonic devices to correspond to the function of each attribute, while also depicting the symmetry and complementary nature of the model. Over the years, it has been updated and tweaked to reflect both the developments and applications of Locus thinking.

While I cannot share the entire textbook that I worked on to develop the content and design for, I will share experts of my favorite chapter, Semiotics. The purpose of the chapter is to highlight visual symbols embedded with meaning gradually are combined to communicate more complex topics.

The cover art was carefully chosen to reflect the function of the book. The light purple square represents a book resource and the light orange circle represents the activity of teaching.

The basic elements of the Locus Model (activities, resources, Economic Systems) are all represented by basic geometric forms (circles, squares, a collection of the two respectively). Their graphic simplicity is both aesthetic and illustrative of the Locus Model. Graphically, these basic shapes are the building blocks for complex visuals. Each shape has a distinct meaning in the Locus Model: circles represent activities and squares represent resources. When used together, these shapes can convey complex economic phenomena in a simple, intuitive manner.
