I often get asked -- what is data vis? And often I answer with: "Well, it's visualizing data. " Incredibly helpful. I know.

So, inspired by the very unhelpful patent images of the [shape of the internet](https://noahveltman.com/internet-shape/) found by Noah Veltman, I have found equally unhelpful images of data visualizations. Enjoy!
