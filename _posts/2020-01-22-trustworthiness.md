This year I am taking a class taught by my advisor Miriah Meyer on ontologies, epistemologies, and research paradigms. I will have to write another post on what those words mean at some point, but for now I want to focus on an interesting conversation we have been having: how can researchers communicate rigor if their work is qualitative.

### Learning to Trust: a Positivist Perspective

Positivism is a research paradigm often associated with the natural sciences. In the world of positivism, there are objective and generalizable truths that can be measured. Within positivism, research results are judged according to the following criteria:
- **Internal Validity:** how certain are you that the independent variable has effected the dependent variable?
- **External Validity:** how representative is the sample population (and by extension your results) of the general population?
- **Reproducibility & Reliability:** how likely are the results to show up again in another experiment? how well can another researcher run your experiment?
- **Objectivity:** are the measurements value free?

These criteria are often associated with quantitative studies, but they become problematic when there is no *one* answer to your research, no *one* singular truth, and when the socio-, historical-, political- contexts of the experiment can greatly affect your results.

Enter, Lincoln, Guba, and interpretivism.

### Establishing Trustworthiness
The following section is my take on organizing the work presented in [Establishing Trustworthiness](https://ethnographyworkshop.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lincoln-guba-1985-establishing-trustworthiness-naturalistic-inquiry.pdf). Written in 1985, this document from my understanding is a seminal piece in interpretivist research methods. Lincoln and Guba set out to both make a case for interpretivism (the research paradigm that multiple realities exist and it is the role of the researcher to interpret it) and provide practical methods for establishing trust and rigor in qualitative research.

**Credibility:** How congruent are the findings with reality? \\
*Positivist Analogy: internal validity*
<details><summary>Methods</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting appropriate research methods</li>
<li>Establishing a rapport with the participants through long-term engagement</li>
<li>Expanding participants to include randomly selected individuals</li>
<li>Analyzing edge cases and how they fit or don't fit within your research conclusions</li>
<li>Debriefing with peers</li>
<li>Checking your conclusions with the research participants</li>
<li>Triangulating results using different sources of deta, methods of collection, and interpretations</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

**Transferability:** To what extent are the findings applicable to other contexts? It is important to note that the onus of transferring research results falls on the consumer of the research.\\
*Positivist Analogy: external validity*
<details><summary>Methods</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Using thick descriptions to communicate the context</li>
<li>Including information regarding the type of data used (or omitted), length of study, participants, and other relevant details</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

**Dependability:** Have you provided enough information so that other researchers could repeat the work? \\
*Positivist Analogy: reproducibility & reliability*
<details><summary>Methods</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining the research design in rich details</li>
<li>Enumerating the methods of gathering data</li>
<li>Reflexive journaling</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

**Confirmability:** Does your data support your interpretations? \\
*Positivist Analogy: objectivity*
<details><summary>Methods</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Including an audit trail for review</li>
<li>Maintaining transparency about your methods, research design, and conclusion development</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

As you can see, even with these methods, it is hard to grapple with what makes research trustworthy? Especially in a non-positivist paradigm we are relying on individual interpretations, where there will not be one single correct answer. For me, this is the beauty of science that is often overlooked: as humans we have the innate ability to observe the world around us and communicate our observations with others to build collective knowledge, knowing that we may not be 100% correct all the time.
