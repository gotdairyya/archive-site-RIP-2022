I have always been fascinated with how we come to know things. Not just from a memorization perspective (in fact, I remember what I once memorized, but can no longer recall the content, which makes me question _the point_), but rather from an embodied perspective. When do our muscles remember how to ride a bike? or our taste buds recommend the tiniest bit of lemon juice to balance the flavors? The inspiration for this post came when I was exchanging Turkish recipes[^1] with a friend, who was in turn exchanging Bangladeshi recipes. In addition to the recipe, we both included long explanations of what needed to be done so that the recipe would turn out like the way our grand-/mothers made the recipe (aka the right way). The ancesteral, cultural, and gustatory knowledge was embedded in the practice of cooking, eating and family; and yet, mostly missing from the black and white text of the recipes. We attempted to fill in this gap with more text, but it is unclear either of us will make the dishes authentically. This exchange reminded me about two academic concepts that I have been fascinated with as of late: tacit knowledge in science and pedagogical content knowledge in education. Both relate to how _verbs_ are done and the quality to which they are done. Below I include a BRIEF overview of each. I am still new to both fields/concepts, and so I would love further recommendations and to engage in more discussion (just tweet [@gotdairyya](https://twitter.com/gotdairyya)).

In the social studies of science, tacit knowledge has been studied as the magic sauce for getting science done. In H.M. Collins' Paper,[^2] he discusses how tacit knowledge plays an important role in measuring the quality of sapphire. _A brief aside, the shortening of the quality of sapphire is the q of sapphire and that always conjures up for me images of Quailman._ ![GIF of Quailman an early 2000s cartoon character](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4EpkQcjHPsr9tTP2/giphy.gif){:.scale-50-center} It is a super fascinating read discussing how the lingering dynamics of Cold War politics were overcome over by two labs spending time together, learning the way experiments were conducted through engaging in observation and learning, ultimately united by 'the language of science.' If this isn't a thriller, I don't know what is. To read more, I would recommend the works of Susan Leigh Star and Geoffrey Bowker. [^3]

In education research, I've seen tacit knowledge show up as Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). PCK "encapsulates all that the teacher has to know in order to teach a subject effectively". [^4] Effectively could mean how to get the students excited about the topic, how to teach so that students can recall concepts in later and differing concepts, what metaphors tend to work and which ones don't, teaching inclusive design [^5]...There is so much to the act of teaching that extends beyond the content material.

What I have written about is just scratching the surface of the different ways of knowing. I wanted to jot down these inital thoughts, fully recognizing that they are incomplete. From cooking, to social studies of science, to education research knowing about knowing + knowing about doing impact the types of things that can be done and the extent to which they can be done well. How often are we engaging in discussions at this meta-level?

What fascinates me is how can we communicate all the stuff we know about stuff? Are there ways to hint at how little the instructions we write or the data we display represent the full and embodied nature of our knowing? How can technological systems support/obstruct the transfer of knowledge?
