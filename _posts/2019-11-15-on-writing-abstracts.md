Since I can remember I have always doodled in class. It's my method of paying attention to what the instructor is saying while letting my hands and imagination wander. You can imagine how vindicated I felt when studies came out supporting doodling as a method of improving concentration. Here is one [article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-thinking-benefits-of-doodling-2016121510844) in case you're curious.

I haven't actually doodled in a while because I was out of school for 6 years, and well, now that I am back, old habits die hard as the adage goes.
So while we were discussing methods for reviewing academic papers, a fellow classmate of mine mentioned scanning the abstract to determine the relevance of a paper, and think I nearly scoffed in response saying that I never read the abstract anymore. Which got me thinking, are we reading abstracts differently because of our astrological signs? Silly right? Ridiculous even, I know. But I couldn't help doodling about it and eventually came up with this table...
*Drum roll please* I present to you: Abstractology!
